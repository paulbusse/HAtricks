# HAtricks

This repository is here just to store small things I've done in Home assistant. I have a couple in my install and will add them here so people can enjoy them.
I store the different things in separate directories.

This is obviously free, my only ask is that if you enhance this, let me know, so I can use it as well.

* Changing the icon color depending on the state.

## Icon color coding

This directory shows you how to color code icons depending on the state. E.g. battery state.

## Home assistant DB backup

My home assistant database has grown considerably and backup takes long. This is the script to still create consistent backups.

## DB Cleanup

A script to remove rows from the events table based on a query and at a slow pace. Inspired by recorder.purge_entities. Do not use this on the states table. Bad idea.

## Sunnybeamtool
Read information over a USB connection from a sunnybeam.
